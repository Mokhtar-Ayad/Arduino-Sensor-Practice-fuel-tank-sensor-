# Arduino-Sensor-Practice-fuel-tank-sensor-
This is my hands-on workshop for mastering Arduino and sensors. I use practical projects (like making a working fuel gauge) to build the core skills needed for serious embedded systems and telemetry—the foundations for high-performance applications like F1.
